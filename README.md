### Welcome 👋

Welcome! I'm Nate Kist.  I am a former accountant that is transitioning to a career in data science.  My entire accounting career has involved analyzing financial data for auditing purposes or commercial banking due diligence.  I eventually figured out that the part of my jobs I've always enjoyed the most was the handling and processing of data.  I took a break from work to take a data science class remotely through the Flatiron School (NY) to pursue this interest further and learn new skills.  I enjoyed the class so much that I'm trying to make a career out of it.
